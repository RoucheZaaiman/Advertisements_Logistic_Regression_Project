# Advertisements_Logistic_Regression_Project
# Advertisements Logistic Regression Project   In this project I will apply a Logistic Regression model to advertisements data with the aim to determine if a consumer clicked on an ad or not.  These preictions are based on the features of the users. We will be working with made up data.  In this project I use the following libraries and toolkits: Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas and datetime.  #### Some interesting analyses and interpretations from visualizations in this project:    * The ages of consumers that click on ads vary from young to older people and consumers that click on ads tends to come from a variety of areas.  Consumers that do not click on ads tend to come from higher areas with a higher average income. * Consumers who click on ads, in general, spend less time on a site and on the internet than those who do not click on an ad. * The Logistic Regression model predicts whether a consumer clicked on an ad with an accuracy of 98%.
